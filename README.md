# Pokedex-Builder

I decided to write my own minimalistic Pok√©dex. You never know you need until you need it.

A day ago, I published this repo, and it gave me the idea to scrap the necessary information.

Although the application is private and only for me, I am sharing the scraping algorithm and current data publicly for everyone to use.

Note that this is an ongoing project and the current data set is pretty basic. I will try to add more data and create connections with fields soon.

Huge thanks to https://pokemondb.net for providing the information.

Install packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Run: ```python src/pokedex_builder.py```
